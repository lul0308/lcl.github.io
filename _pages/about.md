Hello! I am a graduate student from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University. My research interests are focused on Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the areas of Multimodal Large Models, Medical Image Analysis, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Agents.

This page serves as a showcase for my projects, code, and academic work in these research fields. Here, you can find my explorations into fine-tuning multimodal large models, medical image preprocessing, and applying CoT and agents to practical problems. I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and advancing together!
